Hello! I'm Amanda, and I'm 28 years old.

Since 2014, I've been immersed in the world of technology, and since 2019, I've ventured into the universe of programming. Here in my little corner of the internet, you'll find a collection of learnings, experiences, and projects I've worked on.

Feel free to explore and, who knows, find something that resonates with you.

#### My Journey

I have a degree in Computer Science and currently work as a Software Engineer at PagarMe. Over the years, I've worked with various technologies, including C#, JavaScript, Go, and modern frameworks like Node.js. Each project I've worked on has taught me something new, and I'm always looking for new challenges.
